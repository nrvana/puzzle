There are five laptops in a row from different manufacturers running different OSs. The five laptops are installed with different endpoint programs, infected with different malware, and have been hacked by a different threat group, one of which is the Carbanak Group. 

The question is: Who was hacked by the Carbanak Group?

	1. The HP laptop has Carbon Black installed.
	2. The Microsoft laptop was hacked by the Lazarus Group.
	3. The Apple laptop runs macOS.
	4. The laptop with Cylance installed is on the left of the laptop with MS ATP installed.
	5. The laptop with Cylance installed runs Windows XP.
	6. The laptop infected with PlugX was hacked by Sofacy.
	7. The laptop with McAfee installed is infected with Poison Ivy.
	8. The laptop in the center runs CentOS.
	9. The laptop infected with Wannacry is next to the laptop hacked by the CommentCrew.
	10. The Dell is the first laptop.
	11. The laptop hacked by the Equation Group is next to the laptop infected with Poison Ivy.
	12. The laptop infected with RAWPOS runs Solaris.
	13. The Lenovo is infected with Stuxnet.
	14. The Dell is next to the laptop running Tanium.
	15. The laptop infected with Wannacry is next to a laptop running Windows 10.

Any combination is possible, do not assume that Wannacry only executes on Windows or that Equation Group is known to use Stuxnet, etc. There are no tricks and you have enough information to find the answer using pure logic.
